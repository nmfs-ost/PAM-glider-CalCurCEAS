# glider-CalCurCEAS

Repository for passive acoustic glider efforts overlapping with CalCurCEAS (California Current Cetacean and Ecosystem Assessment Survey) 2024. This project is part of NOAA's [PAM Strategic Initiative](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/PAM_National_NMFS_Network/content/SI_Coordination.html) and UxS Strategic Initiative. 

This repository contains survey planning and analysis documentation and code. 
Glider piloting files, raw acoustic files, and large analysis outputs *should not* be stored here.

#### Data availability

Recordings will be made available at NCEI once they have been fullying processed and screened. The link will be provided here. 

Glider piloting/environmental data and raw and processed acoustic data are stored on the PIFSC server (too large to store via GitHub). The folder structure is as as follows:
