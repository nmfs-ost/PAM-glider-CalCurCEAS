# Open program

-   Start menu, navigate to Raven-X
    -   Alternative `C:\Program Files\RavenX\DataMining_Developer\application\Raven-X.exe` (although this will vary based on how/where it was installed)
    -   Standalone version may need to be accessed differently

Two windows appear - a background command window and a MATLAB GUI window

# Set metadata

### Access Metadata window

-   Tools menu \> Metadata

New window will pop up

### Deployment Information tab

#### Enter Deployment Information

-   For the Deployment Identifier, use standard glider mission string (e.g., sg639_CalCurCEAS_Sep2024)
    -   *Note: The output `_MANTA_Metadata.xlsx` filename cannot be longer than 31 characters so the input mission string can only be a max of 16 characters so may need to use a shortened version like just the glider and year or something*
-   Use GPS lat/lon from first dive of GPS Surface Table
-   Leave hydrophone depth as 0
-   Set Analysis Start Date as the timestamp of the first acoustic file
-   Set Analysis End Date as the timestamp of the last acoustic file + the file duration

Deployment Info OK indicator on left will now be green

#### Calibration Configuration

-   Select 'Hydrophone'
-   Select 'System, sensor, and preamp types'
-   Uncheck 'I have a pistonphone calibration'

### Recorder Information tab

#### Recorder Data

-   Set Recorder Type to 'I have a custom data'
-   Set Name to 'WISPR3'
-   Set Sample Rate in Hz (e.g., 200000 for WISPR3)
-   Set ADC bits (e.g., 24 for WISPR3)
-   Set Maximum Input Voltage (e.g., 5 for WISPR3)
-   Set Serial Number as some sort of identifier for that recorder (e.g., no4 for WISPR3)
-   Click the 'Load Recorder Gain File' button to load the zero gain default file
    -   Navigate to `MANTA\calibrationinformation\recorders` (if installed in default location this should be in `C:\Users\user.name\Documents`)
    -   Choose the `zeroGainRecorder_2.csv`
    -   *Note: The default `zeroGainRecorder.csv` that came with MANTA caused an error when loading (only after turning on the preamp setting) but troubleshooting showed that renaming the 'sensitivity' column to 'gain_dB' got rid of this error*

#### Sensor Data

The example HTI calibrations (in `MANTA\calibrationinformation\hydrophones` are not perfect for what we have so created a custom one based on one of the glider hydrophones - a calibrated HTI-92-WB SN#653007. The original and MANTA formatted versions are saved in the `noise` folder of this repository and a copy was saved within the MANTA `calibrationinformation\hydrophones` folder. This is the correct calibration to use for some glider missions (that used this hydrophone!)

-   Set Sensor Model to 'I have a custom data'
-   Leave Recorder Channel Number as 1 and Freq. Independent Gain as 0
-   Fill in the Sensor Serial Number with the hydrophone serial number (e.g., 653007)
-   Click 'Load Sensor Calibration' to select the correct hydrophone sensitivity file
    -   This should be a CSV with a column 'frequency' and a column 'sensitivity'
    -   MANTA provides some example HTI sensitivities (in `MANTA\calibrationinformation\hydrophones`) but none of these is correct for the type we have for the Seagliders/WISPR (i.e., the 3 kHz sensitivity of the glider HTI-92-WBs is \~-165 but the MANTA example for HTI-92's is \~-175)
    -   I created an example Seaglider/WISPR calibration for the HTI-92-WB SN#653007 which is saved in the `noise` folder of this repository
-   Enter the Pream Serial Number if available
    -   If this is not available for WISPR3, an example/representative curve such as EOS_HM1_1507 can be used (*THIS NEEDS MORE WORK*)
-   Click 'Load Preamp Calibration'

Recorder Info OK and Sensor Info OK indiciators on left will now be green

### Calibration Results tab

The output of the calibration input information will be displayed on this tab after everything turns green.

### Generate MANTA File

Hit this button and got an error pop-up that syas 'Deployment parameters: { Depth, Deployment Date } Not set - continue with file creation?'

Just hit Yes

Navigate to the calibratioinformation\metadata\_files folder as the output folder

Got an error

```         
Error using MANTA_MetaData_App/GenerateMANTAPushed (line 1529)
Invalid sheet name. Name must be text and contain 1-31 characters, excluding :, \, /, ?, *, [, and ].

Error in appdesigner.internal.service.AppManagementService/tryCallback (line 368)

Error in matlab.apps.AppBase>@(source,event)tryCallback(appdesigner.internal.service.AppManagementService.instance(),app,callback,requiresEventData,event) (line 37)

Error using matlab.ui.control.internal.controller.ComponentController/executeUserCallback (line 386)
Error while evaluating Button PrivateButtonPushedFcn.
```

Error went away when identifier was just 'sg639' - I think because too long?

Output file is named sg639_MANTA_Metadata.xslx

sg639_Sep2024_MANTA_Metadata

# Load sound files

-   Right click on black 'Sound Set' box and choose 'Add Sound Set'
-   Select the folder
-   Set up the timestamp from the names
    -   Can save it for future use.
    -   For WISPR_YYMMDD_hhmmss.flac the 2 digit year should start at location 7, 2 digit month at location 9, and so on
    -   *Note: After initial entry/save I got an error but when I tried to repeat and just loaded the saved version it worked fine*

# Load calibration file

-   Right click on black 'Cal File Assignment' box and choose 'Assign Cal (xlsx) to Selected Sounds'
-   Navigate to the `MANTA\calibrationinformation\metadata_files` folder and select the cal file made earlier

# Process data

-   On the Data Mining Algorithm (but missspelled...) tab, select 'manta.RX.Modules.MIN to get results as hybrid millidecades (HMD)

#### Set processors

-   Open the Tools menu and select Processors
-   Specify the number of processors
    -   Use Task Manager \> Performance \> CPU to see the number of cores available (listed at bottom)
    -   Recommended by ONMS is 8
-   Set Select Processor Pool to local
-   Check box for ReUse Procesing Pools

#### Check Output settings

-   On the Output menu check that the following defaults are all checked:
    -   pcntl
    -   psd
    -   csv
    -   NetCDF
    -   mp4

![Screenshot](manta_screenshots\outputs_menu.png)

#### Check Settings settings

-   On the Settings menu check that the following defaults are all checked:
    -   Data Mining - Enable Parallel Output Queues
    -   Data Mining - Clean Hour Logs During Run
    -   Time - Merge Intervals
    -   Time - Force time frame
    -   Sound Plan - Do Not ReUse Existing Sound Plan

![Screenshot](manta_screenshots\settings_menu.png)

#### Run

Hit green Run Jobs button

-   If you get a firewall message select allow
    -   I was not able to select allow but hit Cancel and things still seem to be running...
-   Watching progress in terminal got some warnings but they didn't seem to care


# Check results

Data is stored in the `MANTA\datamining_data\output\DECIIDEC_MinRes` folder in a folder for this dataset. The naming seems a bit odd but some pieces of what was input in the metadata should point you to the right thing.

Results will include:

-   A figure of the calibration info
-   A folder (in this example named `ch_WISPR_240914_181731`) that includes 4 folders `csv`, `netCDF`, `pctl`, and `psd`
    -   Within each folder there is a file for each day
